PIO VGA Pico Demo
-------------------

This is the code described in my blog:
https://gregchadwick.co.uk/blog/playing-with-the-pico-pt5/. Read that for full
details.

The files present are:

* `pio_vga_first.c` and `video_first.pio` - Testing video signal timing using
  a PIO logic analyzer, doesn't generate an actual video signal
* `pio_vga_second.c` and `video_second.pio` - Generates a 320x240 video test
  pattern
